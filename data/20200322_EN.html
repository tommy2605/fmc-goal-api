<p><strong>Viewing from the perspective of the eternity</strong></p>
<p>Fanny Crosby had lost her vision since she was a baby. Amazingly, she grew to become one of the best known writer of Christian hymns of all time. Fanny, who was blessed with a long life, wrote more than 9.000 songs throughout her life. Some of her favourite hymns to date are &ldquo;Blessed Assurance&rdquo; and &ldquo;To God Be the Glory&rdquo;. A well-intentioned pastor once said, &ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s a pity God doesn&rsquo;t give you vision, even though He gave you so much talent.&rdquo; </em>&nbsp;Fanny gave an answer that seemed hard to believe, &ldquo;<em>Sir, if I could have made a request when I was born, I still want to be born blind. Thus, when I arrive in the heaven later, the first face that I will see and make me happy is the face of my Saviour.&rdquo;</em> Fanny view life from the perspective of eternity.</p>

<li>The problems we face will look different if we look at them from the perspective of eternity. <em>&ldquo;For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal&rdquo; (</em><strong>2 Corinthians 4:17-18</strong><em>).</em></li>
<li>All trials will disappear when we think about the glorious day we will meet with Jesus.

<li>Paul is not just looking at the positive side, if he says that although his body is becoming weak because of the suffering he experienced, his spiritual life was renewed and strengthened by God&rsquo;s power (<strong>2 Corinthians 4:16</strong>). His horizon of thought reaches the eternal hope (<strong>2 Corinthians 4:18</strong>), which is the dwelling place in heaven, which God has provided to replace the one on earth.</li>
<li>God, help us to view life from a heavenly perspective. Remind us that no matter how difficult our trials, they will disappear when we meet You.</li>

<p>The way we see eternity will determine the way we live our lives today.</p>

The Fulfilment of Eternal Life
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Being successful&rdquo; is everyone&rsquo;s dream. But to be truly successful, it is not enough with just science, but one should also have wisdom. &ldquo;The most important thing to succeed is wisdom&rdquo; (<strong>Ecclesiastes 10:10</strong>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>CONTENT</h1>
<p><u>There are three notions of wisdom in the Bible</u>, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Technically, wisdom is a skill that is given by God to execute something perfectly (Exodus 31:3).</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wisdom is an expertise given by the Lord to a person.</li>
<li><u>And everyone possess this kind of wisdom</u>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, regardless of a sinner or not, he can succeed if he uses his talent and expertise. The Lord has given each one of us talent and expertise according to our ability. We have to realize, appreciate, use it and develop it.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Intellectually, wisdom is the ability to draw up a right plan and a good way to get the desired results (Genesis 41:39).&nbsp;</strong>This kind of ability is called wisdom. We often delay doing something that improves our lives due to lack wisdom. We do not know how but with wisdom, we can succeed.</li>
<li><strong>Spiritually, <u>Wisdom is the knowledge given by God</u>.&nbsp;</strong>The mankind needs wisdom to be able to:
<ul>
<li>know his Creator well (<strong>Ephesians 1:17</strong>),</li>
<li>do what God wants (<strong>Exodus 31:3</strong>) and</li>
<li>make the right decisions in difficult situation (<strong>1 Kings 3:9, 24</strong>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h1>
<p>Through wisdom:</p>
<ul>
<li>a slave can become a successful person (<strong>Joseph)</strong></li>
<li>a simple man became a leader (<strong>Daniel)</strong>,</li>
<li>one could lead millions (<strong>Solomon</strong>),</li>
</ul>
<p>therefore &ldquo;<strong>Wisdom is the foremost important for success</strong>&rdquo; (<strong>Proverbs 16:16</strong>).</p>

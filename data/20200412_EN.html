The Fulfilment of Eternal Life
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>A blessed &ldquo;<strong>PASSOVER</strong>&rdquo;, the <strong>resurrection</strong> of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> from the death! Let us read the story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<strong>Mark 16:1-8</strong>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>resurrection of Jesus</strong> brings:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Renewal of life (Mark 16:1-6).&nbsp;</strong>The action of the women to embalm the body of Jesus (what is usually done for people who died) early in the morning was in vain as Jesus had already risen. Only the body of a deceased person should be embalmed or preserved. Do not live in the same habit or thinking, but start a new and hopeful life with Christ who rose again (<strong>2 Corinthians 5:17</strong>). Change also your way of thinking with God&rsquo;s unlimited wisdom, as discussed in our theme for this month &ldquo;The Fulfilment of Wisdom&rdquo; (<strong>Psalms 9:7-EN, Romans 12:2</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Living by faith (Mark 16:3-4).&nbsp;</strong>The problem at that time for Mary Magdalene and the two women was the large stone that was blocking the access to the tomb. But <u>the stone has been rolled away</u>, because <u>Jesus has risen</u>. When we face many problems (just like the stone to block the tomb), that is sickness, pressure, difficulties and thoughts that are tangled (by trauma, unbelief, or worries), we should <strong>BELIEVE</strong> that He, who is alive, has opened a way for each one of us (<strong>Romans 4:17-21</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Victory and encourage us to preach the Gospel (Mark 16:16-17).&nbsp;</strong>The Gospel is a holy message and cannot be destroyed (<strong>Mark 16:8b</strong>). Eternal life is in the Gospel message itself as the Gospel is God&rsquo;s power to save every believer (<strong>Romans 1:16-17</strong>). It is time for us to continue to testify and win many souls for the kingdom of God. Thus, we carry out the vision of our Lord (<strong>John 3:17</strong>).</li>
</ol>
<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Let us, as we celebrate the PASSOVER today, receive God&rsquo;s truth, so that we will rise out of a mediocre life.</p>

The Fulfilment of Eternal Life
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1><p>Everyone will definitely experience death and need an eternal life.</p><p>Therefore we will learn the three important things regarding eternal life as it is written in&nbsp;<strong>Matthew 19:19-26</strong>.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h1>CONTENT</h1><ol><li><strong>Eternal life is not obtained by doing a number of good deeds (verses 16-20).&nbsp;</strong>This young man believed that good deeds will lead people to eternal life. The standard of good deeds according to men (which men are capable of doing) still does not match the standard of God&rsquo;s goodness which is whole and perfect. Therefore our good deeds will not save us.</li><li><strong>Wealth/materialism may become a barrier to obtaining eternal life (verses 21-24).&nbsp;</strong>Wealth not only made a rich person not love his neighbour and God, but also made him not love himself. In order to keep his treasure, he is willing to let himself perish in eternity by ignoring all the commands of God. Wealth itself is not the problem, but our attitude towards wealth can be a problem. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also (<strong>Matthew 6:21</strong>).</li><li><strong>Eternal life can only be obtained through faith in Jesus (verses 21b, 25-26).&nbsp;</strong>The Bible explains that humans are IMPOSSIBLE to be saved/get eternal life, but for God everything is POSSIBLE and it has been proven by God in Jesus Christ who is the way to eternal life. Therefore eternal life can only be obtained when we have faith in Jesus.</li></ol><h1>CONCLUSION</h1><p>Hence, we know eternal life is only in the Lord Jesus.</p>

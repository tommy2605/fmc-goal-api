The Fulfilment of Eternal Life
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>God offers us eternal life with our Father in Heaven and if we accept the offer and accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour of our lives, then we can live eternally with Him in glorious Heaven <strong>(John 3:16</strong>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>How can we enter into eternal life with a new heaven, and a new Earth?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A firm belief in Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour</strong> (<strong>1 John 5:11-13</strong>).&nbsp; In the journey following the Lord surely we feel there are challenges, but if we want to learn to be the disciples of Christ, our faith must stay strong. That is why FMC discipleship is held through The Ladder of Success, so that we can study the Word of God (<strong>Matthew 28:18-20)</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Be a doer of the Word and not just a hearer</strong> (<strong>James 1:25).</strong></li>
<li><strong>We should live like Christ (1 John 2:6). </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>By understanding the Government of 12 (G12), we grow to be Christ like. We accept the Vision of Christ (<strong>John 3:17</strong>) &amp; have His strategy (<strong>Luke 6:12-13</strong>).&nbsp;</p>
<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Where is the place of eternity? Of course we are certain of Heaven, because in Philippians 3:20-21 it is written that our citizenship is in Heaven. And we will be transformed into a glorious body of Christ and be reigned with Him.</p>

The Fulfilment of The Outpouring of The Holy Spirit
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>After Jesus rose from the dead and when He was about to ascent to Heaven, He told His disciples not to leave Jerusalem and wait for the Father&rsquo;s promise.&nbsp; The Father&rsquo;s promise is the baptism of the Holy Spirit (<strong>Acts 1:4-5, Acts 2:1-4,38-39</strong>).</p>

<p>Have fellowship</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fellowship with the Lord Jesus. </strong><strong>Acts 1:4 </strong><em>&ldquo;And being assembled together with them&hellip;&rdquo;</em>
<p>From this verse we can draw a lesson that in order to receive the Father&rsquo;s promise we must have fellowship with Jesus (<strong>John 14:26</strong>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Through Jesus&rsquo; sacrifice on the cross we who were far from the Father will be able to return and have unity with the Father (<strong>Ephesians 2:12-16, John 14:6</strong>).</li>
<li>The price for that communion is very expensive, the price that Christ must be humbled and crucified. So we need to maintain it (<strong>1 Petrus 1:18-19</strong>).</li>
</ul>
  </li>
<li><strong>The Lord blesses and cares about fellowship (Matthew 18:18-20)</strong>
<ul>
<li>This verse is confirmed by <strong>Psalms 133:1-3</strong>, that the Fellowship of believers in the Lord pleases God and He wants to be in the midst of it.</li>
<li>A Fellowship in the Lord flows the anointing oil, it is a picture of the Holy Spirit that refreshes us and brings blessings to us, His people (<strong>Isaiah 44:3</strong>).</li>
</ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Stay in the fellowship with the Lord and with other believers and the Holy Spirit will flow and pour upon us.</p>

The Fulfilment of Eternal Life
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Our lives should be focused on the eternity (<strong>2 Corinthians 4:16-18</strong>). Money, houses and cars are just temporary things. However, God wants us to believe in Him and to fix our eyes on the things that are invisible as those are of eternal nature.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>CONTENT</h1>
<p>There are two priorities when we live with a focus on the eternity:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The inner man must be greater than the natural man (2 Corinthians 4:16).&nbsp;</strong>Due to the daily worries, we oftenly do forget to renew our inner self but only the natural man (<strong>Matthew 6:31-33, Proverbs 31:10-11</strong>). In Luke 12:16-21 Jesus gives four reasons why He calls the rich man &ldquo;foolish&rdquo;:
<p>1) He only gives priority to material things and ignores spiritual matters.</p>
<p>2) He only thinks of himself above others or God.</p>
<p>3) He is only concerned with the present and ignores the future.</p>
<p>4) He only thinks of his owns plans and ignores God&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>We can renew our inner man every day. The way to do so is to expect the Lord by worshipping, praying and listening to the Word of God (<strong>1 Timothy 4:8; Isaiah 40:29-31; John 5:24, James 4:13-15</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li><strong>The eternal glory is outweighing temporary tribulations (2 Corinthians 4:17)&nbsp;</strong>One, who is focused on the eternal, may experience struggle, but he will withstand (<strong>1 Peter 4:14-16</strong>). Like Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who were willing to die as they refused to worship other gods than the living God, so that they were thrown into a fire oven (<strong>Daniel 3</strong>). Another great example was Moses, who rejected worldly pleasure for the eternal reward (<strong>Hebrews 11:24-27</strong>).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Let us be focused on the eternal life by crucifying our fleshly desires.</p>

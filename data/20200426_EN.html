The Fulfilment of Eternal Life
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip; but wisdom brings success&rdquo;&nbsp; (<strong>Ecclesiastes</strong> <strong>&nbsp;10:10</strong>).</em></p>
<p>The question now is:&nbsp; How do I receive Wisdom?</p>
<h1>CONTENT</h1>
<p><strong><u>There are Four methods for us to receive God&rsquo;s wisdom:</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Asking God (James 1:5). </strong><em>&ldquo; </em>For the Lord gives wisdom; From His mouth <em>come</em> knowledge and understanding<em>&rdquo; (</em><strong>Proverbs &nbsp;2:6</strong><em>). </em><u>Solomon and Apostle Paul prayed </u>that God would give wisdom<strong>, </strong>and God gave it to him (<strong>1 Kings 3:9-10, Ephesians 1:16-17</strong>). Pray and ask for wisdom from God.&nbsp; <u>For with wisdom we know how to use our knowledge.</u></li>
<li><strong>Fear of the Lord (Job 28 : 28)</strong>
<ul>
<li><u>To fear the Lord is to honor the Lord</u>.&nbsp; By honoring the Lord, it will keep us away from evils.&nbsp; We will never be able to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to evil until we want to honor God. God knows we are weak, that is why He is inviting us to come to Him and learn from Him (<strong>Matthew 11:28</strong>).</li>
<li><u>We need to draw near to God</u>, so we have respect for God (<strong>Psalms 25:12, 14).&nbsp; </strong>Our reward of drawing near and honoring God&nbsp; is wisdom. (<strong>Proverbs 9:10</strong>) &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom</em>&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
<li><strong>To pray and to worship God (Daniel 6:10, EN).</strong>
<ul>
<li>Daniel used to worship God three times a day, and God gave Daniel wisdom, so that he was ten times more intelligent than all knowledgeable people (<strong>Daniel 1: 20</strong>). In FMC, we continue to practice praying by THREE MONTHS FASTING AND PRAYER, pray every day at 12.00, 15.00, 18.00 and 21.00. May the Lord Jesus give wisdom to walk this life, especially in times of crisis.</li>
<li>Set aside time to bow before the Lord in prayer and in worship, and you will be surprised that you are more intelligent than others.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
<li><strong><u>Read and meditate on the Word of God </u></strong><strong>(Psalms 119:99-100)</strong>
<ul>
<li>David studied the Word of God and filled his mind and his lifestyle, and he praised the Word of God by saying: &ldquo;Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path&rdquo; (<strong>Psalms 119:105</strong>).</li>
<li>Likewise when Joshua accepted the responsibility of leading the Israelites into the land of Canaan, an important command which he should not ignore was: &ldquo;This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night&rdquo; (<strong>Joshua 1:8)</strong></li>
<li>Furthermore this verse says: &ldquo;so that you may be careful to do (Ampl)&rdquo;. Be careful, in the <u>original Hebrew language</u> means that you act <u>wisely</u>.</li>
<li>The next sentence of this verse says: &ldquo;For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success&rdquo;&nbsp; <strong><em>Wisdom will make someone successful.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
 <p>That is why <strong>Ecclesiastes 10 : 10</strong> says:&nbsp; &ldquo;<strong><em>Wisdom brings success</em></strong>&rdquo;.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Let us ask God to give us His wisdom, and to carry out the Word we hear.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

The Fulfilment of Eternal Life
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p><strong>2 Korinti&euml;rs 5:1-11. The </strong>Hope in heaven has a solid foundation that is far from the acts of encouraging people to be lazy in building up our spiritual life.<br /> On the other hand, that hope will certainly move us to be attentive and diligent in the religious things /worship: therefore, if we hope to dwell with the Lord, we will try (Philotimoumetha, from Greek) and strive for it (<strong>2 Corinthians 5: 9</strong>). Philotimoumetha has a meaning of us being ambitious and try as much as possible like the most ambitious people to achieve the things they want.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Let us observe at the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Apostle Paul was striving for is pleasing God (verse 9).&nbsp;</strong>Just like Apostle Paul we strive to be well pleasing to Him, who has chosen us, so our Great God may say to us, &ldquo;<em>you have done very well</em>&rdquo; (<strong>Matthew 25:21</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Other reasons that lead Paul and the Apostles to be diligent are the thought of the coming judgement (verses 10, 11).&nbsp;</strong>This judgement for example is certain applies to everyone. We must come before the great Judge in His judgement seat, which is the Lord Jesus Christ, to receive for what has been done in the body to minute detailed (to every part of the body), and very fairly, according to what we have done, whether good or bad. The apostle Paul called this terrifying judgment as the terror of the Lord (<strong>verse 11</strong>), and, by pondering on it, he was moved to convince people to repent and live holy, that when Christ comes with power, they can calmly appear before Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Receive the fulfillment of eternal life.</p>
